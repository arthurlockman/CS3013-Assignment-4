CS 3013 - Assignment 4
======================
To compile the program, simply run 

    make 

in the command line. This will generate the *proj4* executable which can be run from the command line. 

    make clean 

will clean all objects and remove the compiled project 4 executable. Please note that this project must be compiled on CCC1 if being compiled on CCC due to ancient versions of GCC present on other CCC computers.
